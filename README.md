This is the sample project for the [UIScrollView basics](http://corsarus.com/interacting-with-uiscrollview) blog post.

This project shows how to add interactions to an UIScrollView using custom gesture recognizers in addition to the standard pan and pinch gestures.


The code is written in Objective-C.
